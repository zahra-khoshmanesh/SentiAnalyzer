**Abstract:**
Many people are interested to know about the tuition, costs, diversity and potential salary when searching for college. In this project, we want to analyze tuition costs across different states, and explore diversity in different schools. The data set includes different variables such as school name, state, type of school, in-state/out-of-state tuition, group/racial/gender category, early/mid-career pay, stem percent and historical tuition information. We are also interested in trends of tuition over time. We will use different summary statistics and visualizations in R to address these problems.



### Getting familaiar with data

```{r, message=FALSE}
address<-c('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-03-10/')

tuition_cost <- readr::read_csv(paste(address,'tuition_cost.csv',sep=""))

tuition_income <- readr::read_csv(paste(address,'tuition_income.csv',sep=""))

salary_potential <- readr::read_csv(paste(address,'salary_potential.csv',sep=""))

historical_tuition <- readr::read_csv(paste(address,'historical_tuition.csv',sep=""))

diversity_school <- readr::read_csv(paste(address,'diversity_school.csv',sep=""))
```

```{r}
tuition_cost%>%glimpse()
tuition_income%>%glimpse()
salary_potential%>%glimpse()
historical_tuition%>%glimpse()
diversity_school%>%glimpse()
```
